This project (game) is inspired by a problem in an algorithm competition held by our school.
 Since I am not familiar with the front-end operation of c++, I use standard input and output to operate.

This game operation mode

After entering the game, through the input coordinates to set their chess pieces position. 
The position of the board (1,1) is the top-left grid of the board.
 When input, the ordinate is first and the abscissa is last.
